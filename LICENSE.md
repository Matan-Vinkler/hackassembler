# Not-So-Serious License

## The "Don't Be Evil" Clause

You are free to use, modify, and distribute this software, but only if you promise not to be evil. By "evil," we mean anything that involves unleashing a horde of angry squirrels in a data center or creating a computer virus that plays annoying '90s pop songs on loop. If you can't agree to this, close this file now!

## The "No Warranty, No Cry" Disclaimer

This software comes with absolutely no warranty. It might work flawlessly, or it might cause your computer to develop a sudden obsession with disco dancing. We accept no responsibility for any potential disco-related mishaps.

## The "Mandatory Dance-Off" Provision

In the unlikely event that you find a bug, you are required to challenge the author to a dance-off. The author will provide a disco ball and a suitable playlist. Winner takes all bug-fixing responsibilities.

## The "Squirrel Loyalty" Clause

By using this software, you agree to befriend at least one squirrel and share your snacks with them. Failure to do so may result in spontaneous code breakage, and the author accepts no responsibility for lost data, squirrelly retaliation, or nut-related accidents.

## The "Forever and Ever" License

This license is eternal and applies to your use of the software for as long as you live. It also applies to the digital ghosts of your AI descendants, should they decide to continue your work after your time has passed.

## The "Tech of Compliance"

If you can't comply with these terms, please enjoy a [Tech-House Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anV7L76_t9A) and remember to have fun with your project anyway!
